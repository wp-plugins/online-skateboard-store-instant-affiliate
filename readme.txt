This plugin registers your site with the Online Skateboard Store Affiliate Program and automatically adds affiliated links to your blog posts.

== Description ==
This plugin is the fastest way to turn your Wordpress blog into a profitable revenue source through affiliate marketing.

In a typical Affiliate Program you must register for an account on the merchant's website, wait for approval, read through countless pages of documentation,
request access keys and affiliate ids, copy/paste affiliate links into your blog posts, etc. in order to place affiliated links in your blog and be paid when
people follow your links to the merchant's site and make purchases.

With this plugin, we do all of that for you.

When you activate the plugin, it creates your affiliate account with onlineskateboardstore.com using your email address and site name from your Wordpress settings
and sends you an email with your affiliate account info so you can login at http://www.onlineskateboardstore.com and see your affiliate sales reports.

When your site displays a blog post, we automagically replace any of our industry buzz words with links that include your affiliate id so that when a visitor to 
your blog clicks on a link and is taken to our site to complete a purchase, you get paid!

All you have to do is blog about topics related to our site. We take care of the rest.

It doesn't get any easier than this to enter the world of paid blogging through affiliate marketing.
